# Shootsta Code Challenge

Code challenge I did for Shootsta

## Front-end

Code located in folder `client`

## Back-end

Code located in folder `api`

## Setup

Run `npm install` in both the client and api directories.

Start the API server first with the `npm start` command in the api folder

In a separate terminal window run the client code with `npm start` command in the client folder
